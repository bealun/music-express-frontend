# Music Express Frontend

This is the frontend part built with React.js connected to: https://github.com/bealun/project-express-api 🎼🏆💥🌼

## The problem

I have used the API from a backend project to showcase info about the top 50 songs. The first page displays all of the music from the list where each card is linked to showcase details about that specific song. This is built with react router to navigate between the pages.
